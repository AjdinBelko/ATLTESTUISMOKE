Api documetation and task description was:

  Investigate Contact List application and create test plan: https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/

  Write UI and API test cases for this application (concentrate on real user flows, potentially combining multiple api calls in one test case)
  From all the test cases, identify what you think represents a Smoke Test (UI and API)
  Identify positive and negative test cases
  With a tool or programming/scripting language (JMeter, Python, Ruby, Java, Javascript...), automate the smoke test from #2 (it is plus if you are using some testing framework in any of the       listed programming/scripting languages)
  create Github repository and push your assignment solution with the documentation on how to run the automated tests there
  Report bugs if you find any, with detailed steps to reproduce
